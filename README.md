## Glossary

**Intake Asilomar Status**: The following is stated of The Asilomar Accords, an widely known agreement between animal welfare agents:

_In August of 2004, a group of animal welfare industry leaders from across the nation convened at Asilomar in Pacific Grove, California, for the purpose of building bridges across varying philosophies, developing relationships and creating goals focused on significantly reducing the euthanasia of healthy and treatable companion animals in the United States._

This document outlines agreed-upon terms to define an animal's condition upon intake:

_Healthy_ - Animal is healthy and pose no safety or health risk.

_Treatable + Rehabilitable_ - Animal is not healthy but can become so with proper treatment.

_Treatable + Manageable_ - Animal is not healthy and have a permanant condition that, with consistent treatment, does not impact the animal's quality of life.

_Unhealthy + Untreatable_ - Animal has behavioral issues that are unmanageable for pet owners, or has a disease or injury that negatively impacts the animal's quality of life.

**Intake Reason**: The main reason for which the animal is brought in to Metro Animal Services.

**TNR**: Stands for Trap, Neuter(Spay), Return. This refers to the practice of trapping stray animals, to neuter/spay them and then return them to their previous environment. This helps cut down the stray population and gives the animal a chance out in the wild.

**RTO**: Stands for Return to Owner. This refers to an outcome type in which the animal is returned to the owner of the animal. For example, an owner can bring the animal in for veterinary services or the animal was turned in at at Animal Services because it was found away from home.
